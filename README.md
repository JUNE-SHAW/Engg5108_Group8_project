The rate and volume at which fake news are spread  overturn the possibility of efficient fact checking.Additionally,creating tools for automatic detection is as challenging due to lack of dataset containing articles which present fake or manipulated stories as compelling facts.At the same time,many governments and technology companies begin to take actions and some related competitions were held to tackle this problem. In the last three years,most of the research in this area are developed along with the publishing of some new techniques and methods.In our project ,we consider a classification task on the Fake News Corpus dataset,one of the open source datasets on github.Some algorithms or techniques such as SVM will be used in our project,and we will also deploy some related course content(e.g.clustering and classification,text processing and NLP) to our project.A machine learning model will also be built to aid us solve the problem.
